# Create your own mad lib  that collects (at least) the following information:
#
# At least 2 strings
# At least 2 numbers
# And includes the following elements:
#
# One list/array
# One conditional statement with at least one logical operator
# One function
#   Must return a value
#   Must have and use parameters
# One loop


# And meet the following requirements:
#
# The mad lib's code must be well commented.
# Comments should explain code, not just label.
# All elements should have a purpose within the greater madlib.
# (In other words you can't create an array or function that isn't used)
# You must make required number meaningful commits to this file in your repository
# Any errors will earn an automatic ZERO on this assignment.
# Your mad lib should print out the entire story to the console.
